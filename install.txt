Note: Installation does not work yet - you have to bootstrap. Play with the
``koch.py`` script to compile the compiler. 
Compile the compiler:: 

  python koch.py nim

To bootstrap (does not work yet)::

  python koch.py boot


Installation
============

Note:
  A C compiler is required - knowledge of C is not!

Installation on UNIX
--------------------

The GNU C Compiler is fully supported, other compilers may work. The C compiler
should be in your ``$PATH`` (most likely the case). Note that some Linux
distributions do not ship with a C compiler preinstalled - then you have to
install one.

After you have made sure that a C compiler is available, install Nimrod
by downloading the appropriate ``.zip`` file and extracting it to a
directory of your choice. The Nimrod Compiler will stay in this
directory; do not use a temporary one! Good choices are ``/opt/nimrod`` or - 
if you don't have root access - ``~/programs/nimrod``.
Then run the following command::

  python koch.py install

Unlike other software, Nimrod does not distribute its files over the whole file
hierarchy. This has the advantage that you can deinstall it by just deleting
its folder. The disadvantage is that you have to add it to your ``PATH``
manually. The alternative is to create a symbolic link in ``/usr/bin``::

  [sudo] ln -s $your_install_dir/bin/nimrod  /usr/bin/nimrod


Installation on the Macintosh
-----------------------------

Only MacOS X is supported.
Since MacOS X is UNIX based too, it works like the installation on UNIX. You
need to install Apple's developer's tools for the GNU Compiler Collection
though.


Installation on Windows
-----------------------

Windows does not ship with a C compiler; you have to install one. The
following C compilers are supported under Windows:

- | Digital Mars C++
  | http://www.digitalmars.com/download/freecompiler.html

- | Watcom C++
  | http://www.openwatcom.org/ftp/

- | Borland C++ (5.5 or above; including Borland C++Builder)
  | http://www.borland.com/downloads/download_cbuilder.html
  | (Download the package under "compiler" - this requires registration though.)

- | Microsoft's Visual C++
  | http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc
  | (You may need the SDK too - but not the full one: Essential are only
    the win32api header files and import libraries.)

- | Gnu C Compiler (the mingw version; the cygwin version has not been tested!)
  | http://www.mingw.org/download.shtml

- | LLVM with GNU C/C++ frontend
  | http://llvm.org/releases/download.html#2.2

- | Pelles C Compiler
  | http://www.smorgasbordet.com/pellesc

- | Lcc-win32
  | http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~lcc-win32

All of the above compilers are available for free!
(The first three are the easiest to install.) If you want a small download,
choose Digital Mars C++ -- it is easy to install and only about 3 MB.
If you want the highest possible performance, go for Microsoft's Visual C++ or
LLVM.

After you have made sure that a C compiler is available, install
Nimrod by downloading the appropriate .zip file and extracting it to a
directory of your choice. The Nimrod Compiler will stay in this
directory; do not use a temporary one! Then run ``config.exe`` in the
``bin`` subdirectory. Choose your C compiler and press ``OK``. You should
add Nimrod to your ``$PATH``.

Alternatively, you can install Nimrod with the ``koch.py`` script just like
in the UNIX installation instructions. 

Nimrod does not use the Registry and can be removed by just deleting its folder.
