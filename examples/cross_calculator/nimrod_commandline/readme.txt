In this directory you will find the nimrod commandline version of the
cross-calculator sample.

The commandline interface can be used non interactively through switches, or
interactively when running the command without parameters.

Compilation is fairly easy, just include the path to the backend in your
compilation command. A basic build.sh is provided for unix like platforms with
the correct parameters.
