Developers needed
=================
Yes, this is nothing new. If you are interested to help designing and 
implementing the new programming language Nimrod, visit our project page at 
Launchpad: https://launchpad.net/nimrod and contact me.


2008-08-22 Version 0.6.0 released
=================================

Nimrod version 0.6.0 has been released! Get it `here <./download.html>`_.
**This is the first version of the compiler that is able to compile itself!**
A nice side-effect from this is that a source-based installation does not 
depend on FreePascal any longer.

Changes:
* various bug fixes, too many to list them here
* cleaned up the type system: records are now superfluous and not
  supported anymore
* improved the performance of the garbage collector
* new modules in the library: 
  - ``parseopt``: a simple to use command line parser
  - ``hashes``: efficient computation of hash values
  - ``strtabs``: efficient mapping from strings to strings 
  - ``parsecfg``: an efficient configuration file parser 
* macros and compile-time evaluation implemented (however, still experimental)
* generics implemented (however, still experimental)
