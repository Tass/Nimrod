=======================
Nimrod Standard Library
=======================

Though the Nimrod Standard Library is still evolving, it is already quite
usable. It is divided into basic libraries that contains modules that virtually
every program will need and advanced libraries which are more heavy weight.
Advanced libraries are in the ``lib/base`` directory.

Basic libraries
===============

* `system <system.html>`_
  Basic procs and operators that every program needs. It also provides IO
  facilities for reading and writing text and binary files. It is imported
  implicitly by the compiler. Do not import it directly. It relies on compiler
  magic to work.

* `strutils <strutils.html>`_
  This module contains common string handling operations like converting a
  string into uppercase, splitting a string into substrings, searching for
  substrings, replacing substrings.

* `os <os.html>`_
  Basic operating system facilities like retrieving environment variables,
  reading command line arguments, working with directories, running shell
  commands, etc. This module is -- like any other basic library --
  platform independant.

* `math <math.html>`_
  Mathematical operations like cosine, square root.

* `complex <complex.html>`_
  This module implements complex numbers and their mathematical operations.

* `times <times.html>`_
  The ``times`` module contains basic support for working with time.

* `parseopt <parseopt.html>`_
  The ``parseopt`` module implements a command line option parser. This 
  supports long and short command options with optional values and command line
  arguments.

* `parsecfg <parsecfg.html>`_
  The ``parsecfg`` module implements a high performance configuration file 
  parser. The configuration file's syntax is similar to the Windows ``.ini`` 
  format, but much more powerful, as it is not a line based parser. String 
  literals, raw string literals and triple quote string literals are supported 
  as in the Nimrod programming language.

* `strtabs <strtabs.html>`_
  The ``strtabs`` module implements an efficient hash table that is a mapping
  from strings to strings. Supports a case-sensitive, case-insensitive and
  style-insensitive mode. An efficient string substitution operator  ``%``
  for the string table is also provided.

* `hashes <hashes.html>`_
  This module implements efficient computations of hash values for diverse
  Nimrod types.

* `lexbase <lexbase.html>`_
  This is a low leve module that implements an extremely efficent buffering
  scheme for lexers and parsers. This is used by the ``parsecfg`` module.


Advanced libaries
=================

* `regexprs <regexprs.html>`_
  This module contains procedures and operators for handling regular
  expressions.

* `dialogs <dialogs.html>`_
  This module implements portable dialogs for Nimrod; the implementation 
  builds on the GTK interface. On Windows, native dialogs are shown if
  appropriate.
  

Wrappers
========

Note that the generated HTML for some of these wrappers is so huge, that it is
not contained in the distribution. You can then find them on the website.

* `posix <posix.html>`_
  Contains a wrapper for the POSIX standard.
* `windows <windows.html>`_
  Contains a wrapper for the Win32 API.
* `shellapi <shellapi.html>`_
  Contains a wrapper for the ``shellapi.h`` header.
* `shfolder <shfolder.html>`_
  Contains a wrapper for the ``shfolder.h`` header.
* `mmsystem <mmsystem.html>`_
  Contains a wrapper for the ``mmsystem.h`` header.
* `ole2 <ole2.html>`_
  Contains GUIDs for OLE2 automation support.
* `nb30 <nb30.html>`_
  This module contains the definitions for portable NetBIOS 3.0 support. 
* `cairo <cairo.html>`_
  Wrapper for the cairo library.
* `cairoft <cairoft.html>`_
  Wrapper for the cairoft library.
* `cairowin32 <cairowin32.html>`_
  Wrapper for the cairowin32 library.
* `cairoxlib <cairoxlib.html>`_
  Wrapper for the cairoxlib library.
* `atk <atk.html>`_
  Wrapper for the atk library.
* `gdk2 <gdk2.html>`_
  Wrapper for the gdk2 library.
* `gdk2pixbuf <gdk2pixbuf.html>`_
  Wrapper for the gdk2pixbuf library.
* `gdkglext <gdkglext.html>`_
  Wrapper for the gdkglext library.
* `glib2 <glib2.html>`_
  Wrapper for the glib2 library.
* `gtk2 <gtk2.html>`_
  Wrapper for the gtk2 library.
* `gtkglext <gtkglext.html>`_
  Wrapper for the gtkglext library.
* `gtkhtml <gtkhtml.html>`_
  Wrapper for the gtkhtml library.
* `libglade2 <libglade2.html>`_
  Wrapper for the libglade2 library.
* `pango <pango.html>`_
  Wrapper for the pango library.
* `pangoutils <pangoutils.html>`_
  Wrapper for the pangoutils library.
