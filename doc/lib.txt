Though the Nimrod Standard Library is still evolving, it is already quite
usable. It is divided into basic libraries that contains modules that virtually
every program will need and advanced libraries which are more heavy weight.
Advanced libraries are in the ``lib/base`` directory.

Basic libraries
===============

* `System <system.html>`_
  Basic procs and operators that every program needs. It also provides IO
  facilities for reading and writing text and binary files. It is imported
  implicitly by the compiler. Do not import it directly. It relies on compiler
  magic to work.

* `Strutils <strutils.html>`_
  This module contains common string handling operations like converting a
  string into uppercase, splitting a string into substrings, searching for
  substrings, replacing substrings.

* `OS <os.html>`_
  Basic operating system facilities like retrieving environment variables,
  reading command line arguments, working with directories, running shell
  commands, etc. This module is -- like any other basic library --
  platform independant.

* `Math <math.html>`_
  Mathematical operations like cosine, square root.

* `Complex <complex.html>`_
  This module implements complex numbers and their mathematical operations.

* `Times <times.html>`_
  The ``times`` module contains basic support for working with time.


Advanced libaries
=================

* `Regexprs <regexprs.html>`_
  This module contains procedures and operators for handling regular
  expressions.
