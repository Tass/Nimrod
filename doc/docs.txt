  "Incorrect documentation is often worse than no documentation."
  -- Bertrand Meyer

The documentation consists of several documents:

- | `Nimrod tutorial (part I) <tut1.html>`_
  | The Nimrod tutorial part one deals with the basics.

- | `Nimrod tutorial (part II) <tut2.html>`_
  | The Nimrod tutorial part two deals with the advanced language constructs.

- | `Nimrod manual <manual.html>`_
  | The Nimrod manual is a draft that will evolve into a proper specification.

- | `User guide for the Nimrod Compiler <nimrodc.html>`_
  | The user guide lists command line arguments, special features of the
    compiler, etc.

- | `User guide for the Embedded Nimrod Debugger <endb.html>`_
  | This document describes how to use the Embedded Debugger. 

- | `Nimrod library documentation <lib.html>`_
  | This document describes Nimrod's standard library.

- | `Nimrod internal documentation <intern.html>`_
  | The internal documentation describes how the compiler is implemented. Read
    this if you want to hack the compiler.

- | `Index <theindex.html>`_
  | The generated index. Often the quickest way to find the piece of
    information you need.
