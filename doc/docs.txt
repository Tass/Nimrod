  "Incorrect documentation is often worse than no documentation."
  -- Bertrand Meyer

The documentation consists of several documents:

- | `First steps after installation <steps.html>`_
  | Read this after installation for a quick introduction.

- | `Nimrod manual <manual.html>`_
  | Read this to get to know the Nimrod programming system.

- | `User guide for the Nimrod Compiler <nimrodc.html>`_
  | The user guide lists command line arguments, Nimrodc's special features, etc.

- | `User guide for the Embedded Nimrod Debugger <endb.html>`_
  | This document describes how to use the Embedded debugger. The embedded
    debugger currently has no GUI. Please help!

- | `Nimrod library documentation <lib.html>`_
  | This document describes Nimrod's standard library.

- | `Nimrod internal documentation <intern.html>`_
  | The internal documentation describes how the compiler is implemented. Read
    this if you want to hack the compiler or develop advanced macros.

- | `Index <theindex.html>`_
  | The generated index. Often the quickest way to find the piece of
    information you need.
