First steps after installation

This document explains how to *use* the Nimrod compiler.
Open your favourite text editor and type (or download it
`here <download/code/hallo.nim>`_):

.. code-block:: nimrod
   :file: ../tests/hallo.nim

Save this file as ``hallo.nim`` somewhere (I refer to the location as
``$yourloc``). Now open a console and call the Nimrod compiler::

  nimrod compile --run $yourloc/hallo

The ``--run`` switch tells Nimrod that it should run the generated
executable after successful compilation. If things don't work,
check if Nimrod's ``bin`` directory is in your path environment
variable. On Windows the directory ``dist\llvm-gcc4.2\bin`` may
also be required in your path.

Note that Nimrod produced a standalone native executable in
``$yourloc`` that you can run without the Nimrod compiler.
