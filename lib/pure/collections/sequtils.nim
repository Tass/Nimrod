## This module implements operations for the built-in `seq`:idx: type which
## were inspired by functional programming languages. If you are looking for
## the typical `map` function which applies a function to every element in a
## sequence, it already exists as the `each` proc in the `system
## <system.html>`_ module in both mutable and immutable styles.
##
## **Note**: This interface will change as soon as the compiler supports
## closures and proper coroutines.
