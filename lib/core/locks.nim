## This module contains Nimrod's support for locks and condition vars.
## If the symbol ``preventDeadlocks`` is defined
## (compiled with ``-d:preventDeadlocks``) special logic is added to
## every ``acquire``, ``tryAcquire`` and ``release`` action that ensures at
## runtime that no deadlock can occur. This is achieved by forcing a thread
## to release its locks should it be part of a deadlock. This thread then
## re-acquires its locks and proceeds.
