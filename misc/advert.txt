Nimrod 0.5.1 has been released! The is the first public
release of the Nimrod programming language. The compiler
is able to compile simple and some quite advanced
programs. Please give it a try and feedback!

Features:
* Native code generation (currently via compilation to C).
* Garbage collection, but not dependant on a Virtual Machine.
* Portable: The Nimrod Compiler runs on Windows, Linux
  and Mac OS X. Porting to other platforms is easy.
* System programming features: Ability to manage your own
  memory and access the hardware directly.
  You will never have to use C/C++ for that again!
* Zero-overhead iterators.
* Exceptions.
* Modern type system with local type inference, tuples, variants, etc.
* User-defineable operators; new operators often easier to read than overloaded ones.
* High level datatypes: strings, sets, sequences, etc.
* Compile time evaluation without resorting to meta-programming facilities.
* Forward compability: If later versions of the language introduce new
  keywords old code won't break!
* Bindings to GTK2, the Windows API, the POSIX API. New bindings are easily
  generated in a semi-atomatic way.
* A plugable parser system: If you don't like Nimrod's syntax, you can plug
  in a parser and a source renderer for your own syntax!
* A documentation generator with an internal reStructuredText parser: This
  can also be used to write documentation that is not embedded into the
  source code. This makes documentation writing a joy.
* A Pascal to Nimrod conversion utility: This is particularly useful for
  generating bindings to any library which has a Pascal binding
  (these are many!).
