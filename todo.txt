High priority (version 0.8.12)
==============================
- bug: invoking a generic iterator twice triggers a code gen bug (titer2)
* implement message passing built-ins
* add --deadlock_prevention:on|off switch? timeout for locks?
* built-in serialization



version 0.9.0
=============

- bug: tfFinal not passed to generic
- bug: forward proc for generic seems broken
- test the sort implementation again
- warning for implicit openArray -> varargs convention
- implement explicit varargs
- tests: run modules that contain "#RUN_ME", compile the other
  modules; run the GC tests
- fix overloading resolution
- make ^ available as operator
- implement closures; implement proper coroutines

Bugs
----
- bug: generic assign still buggy
  - Optimization: If we use a temporary for the result anyway the code gen
    should make use of this fact to generate better code...


version 0.9.XX
==============

- distinct types for array/seq indexes
- GC: marker procs for native Nimrod GC and Boehm GC
- code concerning 'assert' is wasteful and unnecessarily complex
- implicit ref/ptr->var conversion; the compiler may store an object
  implicitly on the heap for write barrier efficiency
- resizing of strings/sequences could take into account the memory that
  is allocated
- typeAllowed() for parameters...
- find a way to reintroduce the cleanup() pass for C code generation: this
  is hard because of partial evaluation --> symbol files will fix this as
  a side effect
- EcmaScript needs a new and better code gen: simply adapt the C code gen to it
- generalized case statement (requires better transf)
- tlastmod returns wrong results on BSD (Linux, MacOS X: works)
- nested tuple unpacking
- case statement branches should support constant sets
- 'nimrod def': does not always work
- test branch coverage
- checked exceptions
- fix implicit generic routines


Library
-------

- radix tree for strings; maybe suffix tree
- locale support
- bignums
- ftp (and other internet protocols)

- pdcurses bindings
- queues additional to streams: have two positions (read/write) instead of one

- for system:
  proc `@` [T](a: openArray[T]): seq[T] = 
    newSeq(result, a.len)
    for i in 0..a.len-1: result[i] = a[i]
    
  --> ensure @[] calls the array version!


Version 2
=========

- language change: inheritance should only work with reference types, so that
  the ``type`` field is not needed for objects! --> zero overhead aggregation
  BETTER: ``is`` and safe object conversions only work with ref objects. Same
  for multi methods.
  
- explicit nil types?
  * nil seq[int]
  * nil string
  * nil ref int
  * nil ptr THallo
  * nil proc 

- better for backwards compatibility: default nilable, but ``not nil``
  notation:
  
  type
    PWindow = ref TWindow not nil
    
  The problem with ``nil`` is that the language currently relies on it for
  implicit initialization. Initialization is different from assignment. The
  issues can "easily" dealt with by ensuring:
  
    var x = myProc() # checks myProc() initializes every pointer explicitely
    
- the two other parsers
- rethink the syntax: distinction between expr and stmt is unfortunate; 
  indentation handling is quite complex too; problem with exception handling
  is that often the scope of ``try`` is wrong and apart from that ``try`` is
  a full blown statement; a ``try`` expression might be a good idea to make
  error handling more light-weight


Low priority
------------

- ``when T is int`` for generic code
- ``when validCode( proc ()  )`` for generic code
- macros: ``typecheck`` pragma; this allows transformations based on types!
- find a way for easy constructors and destructors; (destructors are much more
  important than constructors)
- code generated for type information is wasteful
